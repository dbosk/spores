\subsection{The Global overlay}

\commentDaniel{%
  We must cover how to do \(\Pr[d \text{ offline at time } t]\) as used in 
  \cref{ExtendRoute}.
  This is probably part of getting random peers in the same place.%

\commentDaniel{%
  What is the probability distribution of the peer sample that we get?
  Will it be close to uniformly random?%

\NewAlgorithm{\GetRandomPeer}{GetRandomPeer}

Every time a device is online, it participates in the random peer sampling 
protocol.
If a device is sampled it provides the following information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item its address;
	\item its public key;
  \item the probability of being online.
\end{itemize}
