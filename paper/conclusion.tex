\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\commentAL{To rewrite as real paragraphs} Future work and prospects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item More in-depth knowledge of the user's behavior would allow to predict devices connections farther in the future;
	\item Changing devices' asymmetric keys regularly would increase security.
	Updating keys is easy in \name given the RPS that propagates new information to all nodes.
	However, more reflection would be needed to avoid key updates breaking ongoing communications passing through the devices in question.

\end{itemize}

It would be interesting to adapt the Sphinx~\cite{Sphinx} cryptographic packet 
format to the routing of \(\SPOR\).
Then we could achieve the properties of Sphinx and enjoy provable security.
