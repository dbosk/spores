\section{Introduction}

% What's the problem?

It is common nowadays to use a third party, \ie someone else's computer (better 
known as the Cloud), as an intermediate to share files.
For instance, it is common for Alice to upload a file to \eg Box, Dropbox or 
OneDrive and share the link with Bob who can then download it.
The goal of this work is to design a decentralized, distributed system where 
Alice can share files \emph{effortlessly} between her own devices, \eg laptop, 
smartphone and tablet.
But Alice should also be able to use her smartphone to share a file on her home 
computer with Bob.
Since these are Alice's private devices, privacy is essential.
E.g.\ it would be devastating for Alice's privacy if Bob could stalk her by 
tracking her devices or discern usage patterns.

% XXX What's the approach? How to solve the problem?

We use a purely \ac{P2P} design.
We first provide \iac{P2P} design connecting Alice's own devices.
This decreases the risk of third-party behavior tracking.
Then we also use \iac{P2P} design to connect Alice's and Bob's devices.
This requires some more care, in this case Bob can track Alice since his devices 
are interacting directly with hers.

\commentDaniel{Summarize our results.}

\commentAL{The proposal:}We propose \name, a \ac{P2P} system for secret file exchange.
Using only devices owned by participants, \name creates onion routes that allow two users to exchange a file such that nobody is able to determine the content of the file, nor its source and destination.
Personal devices, unlike servers, often disconnect from the network. To permit reliable file exchange despite the unreliability of the nodes constituting the system, we use devices' knowledge on their owner's behavior to predict future (dis)connections.
