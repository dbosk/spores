\subsubsection{Simulating user behavior} % (fold)
\label{ssub:simulating_user_behavior}


To evaluate \name, we take interest in users owning a variable amount of devices of different types, and frequently switching among them.
To the best of our knowledge, there exists no real-world dataset of the devices connection times of such a user.
We have thus implemented an evaluation testbed where each user's behavior is simulated  according to the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The user owns a variable amount of devices (3 to 10). We consider the following device types: mobile (e.g. tablet, phone), portable (laptop), fixed (workstation, home computer) and server (such as a NAS, Raspberry Pi or rented appliance);
	\item She can travel between different locations, say her home, her workplace and and outside;
	\item She makes a different use of her devices depending on her location: her home computer will only be accessed at home, while her phone can be accessed everywhere (though she tends to use it the most at home, for instance).
\end{itemize}

We thus model each user with a Hidden Markov Model, as presented in section~\ref{sub:a_model_of_the_user_s_behavior}.
We keep the different possible locations $\mathcal{L}$ to a number of three, and generate different state transition matrices $A$ and emission probability matrices $B$ for each user. 

$B_{*, d}$, the probability that device $d$ is used in each location, depends on $d$'s device type: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item for each location, every mobile device $d_m$ has a random but high probability of being online: $\forall l \in \mathcal{L}, B_{l, d_m} \in [0.6, 1]$;
	\item a portable device $d_p$ has a much lower probability of being used ($\forall l \in \mathcal{L}, B_{l, d_p} \in [0.2, 0.8]$); 
	\item a fixed appliance $d_f$ has a non-zero probability of usage in only one location: $\exists l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall l' \neq l, B_{l, d_f} \in [0.4, 0.8] \& B_{l, d_f} = 0$
	\item a server $d_s$ has a very high probability of working, whatever the user's location: $\exists p \in [0.9, 1], \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, B{l, d_s} = p$.
\end{itemize}
