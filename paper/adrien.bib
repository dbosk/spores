@article{Jesi_Montresor_van_Steen_2010, title={Secure peer sampling}, volume={54}, ISSN={13891286}, DOI={10.1016/j.comnet.2010.03.020}, abstractNote={Gossiping has been identiﬁed as a useful building block for the development of large-scale, decentralized collaborative systems. With gossiping, individual nodes periodically interact with random partners, exchanging information about their local state; yet, they may globally provide several useful services, such as information diffusion, topology management, monitoring, load-balancing, etc. One fundamental building block for developing gossip protocols is peer sampling, which provides nodes with the ability to sample the entire population of nodes in order to randomly select a gossip partner. In existing implementations, however, one fundamental aspect is neglected: security. Byzantine nodes may subvert the peer sampling service and bias the random selection process, for example, by increasing the probability that a fellow malicious node is selected instead of a random one. The contribution of this paper is an extension to existing peer sampling protocols with a detection mechanism that identiﬁes and blacklists nodes that are suspected of behaving maliciously. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that our extension is efﬁcient in dealing with a large number of malicious nodes.}, number={12}, journal={Computer Networks}, author={Jesi, Gian Paolo and Montresor, Alberto and van Steen, Maarten}, year={2010}, month=Aug, pages={2086–2098}}

This paper factors out a fundamental mechanism at the heart of all these protocols: the peer-sampling service. In short, this service provides every node with peers to gossip with. We promote this service to the level of a first-class abstraction of a large-scale distributed system, similar to a name service being a first-class abstraction of a local-area system. We present a generic framework to implement a peer-sampling service in a decentralized manner by constructing and maintaining dynamic unstructured overlays through gossiping membership information itself. Our framework generalizes existing approaches and makes it easy to discover new ones. We use this framework to empirically explore and compare several implementations of the peer-sampling service. Through extensive simulation experiments we show that---although all protocols provide a good quality uniform random stream of peers to each node locally---traditional theoretical assumptions about the randomness of the unstructured overlays as a whole do not hold in any of the instances. We also show that different design decisions result in severe differences from the point of view of two crucial aspects: load balancing and fault tolerance. Our simulations are validated by means of a wide-area implementation.}, number={3}, journal={ACM Trans. Comput.

First we give a concise review of the literature with emphasis on the Baum-Welch algorithm. This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call “left-to-right” models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper.}, number={4}, journal={The Bell System Technical Journal}, author={Levinson, S.
