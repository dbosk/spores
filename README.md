# Private Cloud via your own devices instead of someone else's computer

It's common nowadays to use a third party, e.g.\ the Cloud (i.e. someone else's 
computer), as an intermediate to share files. For instance, it's common to 
upload the file to e.g. Dropbox or OneDrive and share the link with someone who 
can then download it.

The goal of this work is to design a decentralized, distributed system where 
Alice can share files *efforlessly* between her own devices, e.g. laptop, 
smartphone and tablet. Alice can also use her smartphone to share a file on her 
home computer with Bob.

Since these are Alice's private devices, privacy is essential. E.g. it would be 
devastating for Alice's privacy if Bob can track her devices or discern usage 
patterns.
