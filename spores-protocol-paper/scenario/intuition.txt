Alice wants to send her file f (that resides on her laptop L_A) to B.

1/ 	Alice and Bob exchange their encryption keys and the file ID f_{ID} out-of-band
	Alice sets f_{ID} to an invalid reference in the DHT ("not ready yet")

2/ 	Alice queries the DHT for nodes that will most likely be up when L_A is
	The DHT answers with the IDs of middle-men M_1..M_k

3/	When L_A comes online, it cuts f into some chunks, and sends them to M_1..M_k
	Alice updates the DHT entry for F_{ID} with the IDs of middle-men that did receive chunks of f

4/	With the device he wants, Bob queries the DHT for the middle-men's IDs, fetches the chunks of f, and reconstitutes it.
